# dog-years-with-UI
Simplistic but neat dog years calculator web application using JavaSctipt, HTML and CSS.

The user interface takes a name (not required) and age (required) and returns a message upon pressing the 'Calculate'
button that provides a user greeting and converted human age into dog age (years). The first character of an inputted name
will be capitalised; if a name is not provided, the user greeting will default to 'User'. Additionally, the age value 
must be a whole number up to three digits; if not, an alert will display and the button will not send any data.

The visual design was mocked up and created in Adobe illustrator for reference, including the dog logo. Then recreated 
utilising striaght forward HTML and CSS elements.
